== Description ==

Use this new Settings option to override the overly helpful login error messages with a single message. Normally Wordpress errors divulge a bit too much when a user enters an invalid username or password, or attempts a password reset. 

This plugin shows a single, customizable message instead.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the "Login Error Message" submenu item under the "Settings" menu item in the Admin Dashboard to set a custom message.
